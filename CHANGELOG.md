# Changelog - Admin Panel Enhancements

## Version 2.2 - OCR Hero Recognition (Current)

### 🎉 New Features

#### 1. OCR-Based Hero Recognition

- **85-95% accuracy** - Much better than pixel matching
- **Device independent** - No need for specific resolution
- **Easy maintenance** - Only needs hero names, not reference images

#### 2. Dual Recognition Methods
- **OCR Method** (New, Default): Text-based recognition
- **Pixel Matching** (Legacy): Image comparison method
- Both methods available via API parameter
- Backward compatible with existing implementations

#### 3. Test Interface
